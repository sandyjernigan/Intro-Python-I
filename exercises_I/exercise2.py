Exercise 2
A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. 
For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

  def do_twice(f):
    """
    Takes a function and executes it twice.
    """
    f()
    f()

Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice:

  def print_spam():
    print('spam')

  do_twice(print_spam)


1.  Type this example into a script and test it.
2.  Change do_twice so it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
3.  Define a function called print_twice that takes one argument and prints the value of that argument twice.
4.  Use the changed version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.
5.  Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.
