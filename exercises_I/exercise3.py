Exercise 3

Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that

  a**n + b**n == c**n

for any values of n greater than 2.

1.  Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters—a, b, c and n —and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. 
    If n is greater than 2 and a**n + b**n = c**n the program should print, "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!" 
    Otherwise the program should print, "No, that doesn't work."
2.  Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a, b, c and n, converts them to integers, 
    and uses check_fermat to check whether they violate Fermat’s theorem.

Objective challenge: 
  As you write Python programs, it is important to know when to use a certain data structure and when to use something else. 
  Write out an explanation of when and why you would use each data structure: a list, a dictionary, a tuple, and a set.

Objective challenge: 
  Complete the following either in a python script file or directly in the python interpreter:
